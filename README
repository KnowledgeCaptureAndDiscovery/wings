Or build it with additional software using our proposed Docker files. See https://github.com/KnowledgeCaptureAndDiscovery/wings-docker for additional instructions.

Alternative B) Follow the steps below to install WINGS locally:
1. Get war file. Choose from one of the options below:
	a) If installing from source. Download source from https://github.com/IKCAP/wings
	   - mvn install (Do this if you are installing from source and don't already have a war file)
	   - This will create a wings-portal-<version>.war file in portal/target
	b) Or, Download from http://www.wings-workflows.org/download-wings-portal


2. Move the war file to a Servlet container (Tomcat) and rename to wings-portal.war
	- $ mv /path/to/wings-portal-<version>.war /path/to/tomcat/webapps/wings-portal.war


3. Setup an admin user in /path/to/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml
	- Wings admin users need to have the "WingsUser" and "WingsAdmin" roles
